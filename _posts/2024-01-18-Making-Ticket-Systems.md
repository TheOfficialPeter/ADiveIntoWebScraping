### Welcome ðŸ‘‹

> Reading time: ~ 3 mins

I made this small blog post to cover how I initially created a ticket system for a comission and how I had to switch over to another program.



### Part 1: Introduction

Initially I made the design in Figma for Desktop, Mobile devices thereafter I utilized CapacitorJS, VueJS, TailwindCSS and Firebase to create the applications. Everything worked until I had to implement Firebase authentication for the mobile compiled version ( deadline was closing in ) and I had been stuck on a problem for nearly a week so I had to switch to another method of making these apps.

### Part 2: Then came FlutterFlow

I stumbled on a youtube video titled: 'Most overpowered way to build mobile apps?' from `fireship`. Watching this video it seemed like the perfect replacement for the problems I was currently facing. 

### Part 3: Reason I was using Firebase

When I do commissions for clients I always put their needs above my own. In this case I didn't wish for them to have to spend any amount of money on the programs/tools/apps I was making for them. Self-Hosting a backend was out of the options list as well as paid hosting. I did some calculations and Firebase was deemed the perfect backend. It has a really enticing free plan with limitations that will never be reached if I set the program up correctly. ( Other alternatives were: AppWrite, Supabase and NHost )

### Part 4: FlutterFlow is awesome

During my time learning FlutterFlow I noticed how easy it was to make apps. It has so so many features that making most modern apps will take you less than a week.

### Part 5: I misunderstood their problem

The company I was doing this commission for had another meeting with me to once discuss and go over their problem and reasoning for an app and I noticed that they do not wish to have an app built for them. Like I mentioned previously I always put client's needs above my own. Making an app will be useless to them and getting paid for it wasn't my goal, I want them to have something useful. I quickly put the app aside and focused on the main problem at hand.

### Part 6: The actual problem

This commission is for an ISP company that wishses to organize their communication between clients, technicians. I changed my goal to making them a program that will automatically sort and save the important communication data so that it will be more readable and easily understood. For this program I only utilized NodeJS. The program will be run locally on their resources.

### Part 7: Conclusions

"To find the solution you must understand the problem". This is now one of my few personal quotes. I guess doing extra homework never hurts and might just save you time.
